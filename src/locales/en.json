They must be in good general health with no evidence of significant high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, heart disease or hepatitis."}] },
                { "question": "What are the risks of donating a kidney?", "answer": [{ "text": "As with any major surgery, there are risks of physical complications, but these can usually be effectively managed. Short term risks include pneumonia, infection, pain and discomfort, allergic reaction to anesthesia, collapsed lung or blood clots. Rarely, death occurs. In the longer term, potential risks include:", "list": ["Slight increased risk of high blood pressure", "Slight increased incidence of kidney failure", "Possibility of injuring the remaining kidney", "Slight risk of developing a disease of the remaining kidney", "Some people also experience psychological difficulties, although most donors are satisfied with their decision to donate a kidney"] }] },

You may also have a possible loss of salary for time off work for recovery from the surgery, unless you have sick leave coverage from your employer’s company health plan. Some programs may offer financial assistance for these expenses, so speak to the social worker or Living Donor Coordinator at the transplant center to find out more."}] },

Before the surgery, you may also need some time off work for medical tests and appointments, counselling sessions and other aspects of the pre-donation evaluation process." }] },
                { "question": "How do I become a living donor?", "answer": [{ "text": "First, learn as much as you can about living donation, and find out your blood type.

From there, the transplant center staff will lead you through the process." }] },

                { "question": "I've been asked to donate one of my kidneys, but I just don't want to do it. What should I do?", "answer": [{ "text": "If after learning about living donation you choose not to become a living donor, speak to the social worker, counsellor or any member of the health care team at the transplant center. They will support your decision and help you to communicate this decision to the recipient, and family members, in a way that preserves harmony." }] }

                { "question": "If I have indicated my decision for organ donation, will everything be done to save my life?", "answer": "Yes. The first and foremost concern for doctors caring for critically ill patients is to do everything possible to save their lives. The possibility of donation is considered only when all lifesaving efforts have failed." },
                { "question": "How can I make sure my wishes to donate will be respected?", "answer": "Once you’ve registered your intention to donate your organs, it is crucial to speak to your family and loved ones to make sure they know your wishes." }

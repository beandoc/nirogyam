                                A kidney stone is a hard, solid object formed from chemicals in the urine. Normally, urine contains dissolved waste products. When there's too much waste in too little liquid, crystals can form. These crystals attract other elements, growing into a solid mass unless passed from the body. While the kidneys are master chemists at eliminating these substances, sometimes they build up. A stone can remain in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Small stones might pass with minimal pain, but larger ones can block urine flow, causing significant discomfort.

                                Kidney stones vary in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. The larger the stone, the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. Pain occurs when the stone causes irritation or blockage. Common signs include:

                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                                <li>Severe pain on either side of your lower back, or a persistent stomach ache.</li>
                                <li>Blood in the urine (hematuria).</li>
                                <li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>

                                <li>Cloudy or foul-smelling urine.</li>

                                Most stones pass without long-term damage, though often with intense pain. While pain relievers may be sufficient for small stones, larger or more complicated stones might require medical intervention or surgery.

                                Key causes include inadequate water intake, exercise habits (too much or too little), obesity, and diets high in salt or sugar. Infections and family history can also play a role. High consumption of fructose, found in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, is linked to an increased risk.

                                    <p>Diagnosis begins with a medical history, physical exam, and imaging tests. A high-resolution CT scan or a KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) x-ray helps determine the stone's size, shape, and location. Blood and urine tests are also used to assess kidney health and identify potential causes.</p>
